# Vector Database

Skills: Vector Databases, Similarity Search, Indexing

Objective:
Understand how vector databases work and how to optimize semantic retrieval for production-scale systems.

What to learn:
- Embedding models and vector representations
- Indexing strategies and distance metrics
- Metadata filtering and namespace design
- Performance trade-offs (latency vs accuracy)

How to prove:
- Compare vector DB retrieval with and without metadata filters
- Benchmark different embedding models
- Implement similarity search with evaluation metrics

Tools:
- Chroma
- FAISS
- Sentence-Transformers
